### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Greg!  I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for designing order and beauty on the frontend via React.js, and I also enjoy working with databases on the backend with Node.js.  

- I believe in seeking the good way in life, loving your neighbor as yourself, and loving our Creator.
- I'm also a musician and recording artist and music instructor on the side
- I am currently finishing up my time at Lambda School, where I've learned so much about frontend, backend, and writing algorithms in Python.
